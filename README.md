Here’s a detailed summary of what I’ve done:

Imported Libraries:

I started by importing key Python libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, datetime, and matplotlib.pyplot. These tools help with numerical calculations, data manipulation, visualization, and handling dates.
Loaded the Dataset:

I loaded the healthcare dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame using pandas. This gave me the data I needed to work with.
Data Summary and Overview:

I looked at the dataset’s structure using info() to check the data types and non-null counts. I also used describe() to get a statistical summary, including mean, standard deviation, and percentiles.
Checked for Missing Values:

I checked for missing values in the dataset. This step is important for understanding if any data needs to be cleaned or imputed, but I found there were no missing values to deal with.
Listed and Categorized Columns:

I listed all the columns and divided them into numerical and categorical categories based on their data types. This classification helps in applying appropriate analysis techniques.
Explored Unique Values in Categorical Columns:

I explored the unique values in each categorical column to understand the data better. This involved looking at the number of unique values and listing them out.
Data Cleaning:

I performed some data cleaning tasks, including converting the Date of Admission and Discharge Date columns to datetime format for accurate date handling. I also capitalized names in the Name column to ensure consistent formatting.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

I identified categorical columns with fewer than 10 unique values and created bar plots to visualize their distributions.
I used label encoding to convert these categorical variables into numerical format for further analysis.
I created histograms for each numerical column to examine their distributions.
I generated a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical variables, which helps in understanding the relationships between them.
Overall, I’ve cleaned the data, performed exploratory analysis, and visualized key aspects to get a clear understanding of the dataset.
